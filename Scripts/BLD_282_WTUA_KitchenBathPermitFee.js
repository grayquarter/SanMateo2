| Usage: 
|       Assess and invoice fee BLD_010 from BLD_GEN
|       Calculation as follows:
|
|       Case 1: If ASI "Will you be moving / removing load bearing walls?" is set to "Yes",
|               quantity = 0.5*(7.51* (Y))
|               Y = The number entered in the field ASI "What is the cumulative square footage of the areas being remodeled?"
|
|               For example: if ASI "What is the cumulative square footage of the areas being remodeled?" = 100. BLD_011 = 0.5*(7.51*(100)) = $
|
|               If ASI "Will you be moving / removing load bearing walls?" is set to "Yes",
|               quantity = 0.5*(7.51* (Y))
|
|       Case 2: If ASI "Will you be moving / removing load bearing walls?" is set to "No",
|               quantity = 0.5*(6.35* (Y))
|               Y = The number entered in the field ASI "What is the cumulative square footage of the areas being remodeled?"
|
|               For example: if ASI "What is the cumulative square footage of the areas being remodeled?" = 100. BLD_011 = 0.5*(6.35*(100)) = $
|
|       Assess and Invoice fee BLD_067 from fee schedule BLD_GEN
|       Calculation as follows:
|               Valuation amount = ASI "What is the construction valuation including labor and materials?"
|               (Valuation amount /$25,000) the minimum fee is $1.0
|
|               It is $1 per 25,0000 of the valuation amount and fraction there of (always round up to the next dollar value even if it is only 1 cent over)
|               For example: If the valuation amount is 60,000. (60,000/25,000 = 2.4) rounding up to the next dollar, BLD_067 = $3
|
|       Invoice and Assess fee BLD_014 from fee schedule BLD_GEN if ASI  "Is an electrical service upgrade required?" is "Yes"
|       Fee calculation as the following:
|               If ASI: "Is the service upgrade greater than 300 amps?" is Yes, amount = $462
|               If ASI: "Is the service upgrade greater than 300 amps?" is No, amount = $191
|
|       Invoice and Assess fee BLD_061 from fee schedule BLD_GEN
|       Fee calculation as the following:
|               $191 for each additional subpanels, tracked by ASI "Number of main service panels/ subpanels being added, altered, or repaired?"
|               Values can be from 0 to 6, do not charge the fee if the ASI value == 0
|
|       Assess and invoice fee BLD_039
|       Assess and invoice fee BLD_040
|       Assess and invoice fee BLD_043
