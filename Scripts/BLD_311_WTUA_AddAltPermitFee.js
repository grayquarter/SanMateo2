| Usage: On WTUA add and invoice the following fees.
|        BLD_090
|        BLD_067 -  Valuation amount = ASI "What is the construction valuation for this project including labor and materials?"
|                   (Valuation amount /$25,000) the minimum fee is $1.0
|
|        BLD_045 -  (Valuation * 0.00013) the minimum fee is $0
|                   Valuation = ASI "What is the construction valuation for this project including labor and materials?"
|
|        BLD_077 - Are you replacing dry rot or termite damage?" is set to "Yes", 
|                   Project valuation is tracked by ASI "What is the construction valuation for the repair of the dry rot or termite damage including labor"
|                   Quantity = Permit fee from the table in calcPermitFee_BLD_010_BLD_011(Project valuation) function
|
|         BLD_079 - If ASI "Will you be rewiring the electrical?" is set to "Yes"
|                   Project valuation is tracked by ASI "What is the construction valuation for the rewire work including labor and materials?"
|                   Quantity = Permit fee from the table in calcPermitFee_BLD_010_BLD_011(Project valuation) function
|
|         BLD_010 - 4 Square footage fields calculations:
|                   1. Residential footage field "New square footage of conditioned space being added to residence (sq ft)"
|                   2. Unconditioned footage field "New square footage of unconditioned space being added to residence (sq ft)"
|                   3. Decks and patio footage field "New square footage being added / replaced to attached deck / patio / porch (sq ft)"
|                   4. Alteration footage field "What is the cumulative square footage of the areas being remodeled?"
|
|                   Please note that the cacluation also depend on the ASI "Will you be adding / moving / removing load bearing walls?"
|                   if it = "Yes" then it is Structural alteration,
|                   if "No" then it is Non Structural alteration
|
|                   Calculation as follows 0.5*((7 * Residential footage field)+(3 * Unconditioned footage field)+(1.5 * Decks and patio footage field)+(6.5 (if Structural alteration) OR 5.5 (if non structural alteration) * (Alteration footage field))
|
|        BLD_047 - if ASI "New sqaure footage of conditioned space being added to residence" is greater than "0"
|                  Calculation = 2.44 * ( the number entered in the ASI "New sqaure footage of conditioned space being added to residence")
|        BLD_081
|        
| Modified by: Tom Grzegorczyk on 5Jan23 - BLD_045 calculation when ASI "Addition" is "CHECKED": if ASI "What is the construction valuation for this project including labor and materials?" =< 3
|                                          (Valuation?* 0.00013) the minimum fee is?$0.5 else (Valuation?* 0.00028) the minimum fee is?$0.5
